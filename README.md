# JINKS

Jinks is an in-development technology that leverages <<FRAMEOWRKS>> and <<TECHNOLOGU>> in order to verify the user's Identity and state of mind. 
Jinks works by sending a random phrase and having the user repeat it. We then analyze the data and parse it for emotional stability. Jinks then uses that to either verify or deny a transaction.
